## Prerequisites

Before you begin manual testing for Carnesia, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Access to the Carnesia application in the testing environment (either staging or development).
2. Familiarity with the application's features and functionalities.
3. Test data, including valid user accounts, products, and necessary test scenarios.

## Test Cases

The test cases are organized into categories based on the application's functionalities. Each test case should include the following details:

- **Test ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
- **Test Name**: A brief, descriptive name of the test case.
- **Test Description**: A detailed description of the test scenario.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions to execute the test.
- **Expected Results**: The expected outcome or behavior of the application.
- **Actual Results**: The actual outcome or behavior observed during testing.
- **Status**: The status of the test case (e.g., Pass/Fail).

For your convenience, we have provided a sample structure for test cases in the `test cases` tab.

5. Compare the actual results with the expected results.
6. Update the status of the test case in the test case document.

## Bug Reporting

If you encounter any issues or defects during testing, please report them promptly. To report a bug, follow these steps:

1. Create a new issue in the GitHub repository.
2. Provide a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce.
