## Prerequisites

Before you begin manual testing for Carnesia, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Access to the Carnesia application in the testing environment (either staging or development).
2. Familiarity with the application's features and functionalities.
3. Test data, including valid user accounts, products, and necessary test scenarios.

## Test Cases

The test cases are organized into categories based on the application's functionalities. Each test case should include the following details:

- **Test ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
- **Test Name**: A brief, descriptive name of the test case.
- **Test Description**: A detailed description of the test scenario.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions to execute the test.
- **Expected Results**: The expected outcome or behavior of the application.
- **Actual Results**: The actual outcome or behavior observed during testing.
- **Status**: The status of the test case (e.g., Pass/Fail).

For your convenience, we have provided a sample structure for test cases in the `test cases` tab.

## Test Execution

To execute the manual test cases for Carnesia, follow these general steps:

1. Log in to the testing environment using valid test user credentials.
2. Navigate to the specific feature or functionality you intend to test.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the test case to reproduce the scenario.
4. Observe and record the actual results.
5. Compare the actual results with the expected results.
6. Update the status of the test case in the test case document.

## Test Matrix

To provide a clear overview of the testing progress, we maintain a test matrix that displays the status of test cases across various categories and functionalities. The test matrix is regularly updated to ensure transparency in our testing efforts.

## Test Case Report

The test case report should be regularly updated in the `test case report` tab, which should indicate the status of each test case. Any failed test cases should be documented with detailed information about the failure.
